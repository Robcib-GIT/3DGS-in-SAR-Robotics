# DIGITAL TWIN, TELEMATIC CONTROL AND VR GENERATED BY NERF AND 3DGS IN RESCUE TASKS
<div align="justify">
In the digital era, Digital Twins have emerged as key tools for real-time simulation and control of complex physical environments. This final degree project (TFG) presents an immersive telematic control system that combines digital twins with virtual reality (VR) in Unreal Engine, employing advanced technologies such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The research demonstrates the feasibility of integrating these 3D reconstruction methods into rescue operations, providing immersive and detailed visualization of the affected environment, facilitating faster response and reducing risk to rescue teams. The main contributions include the identification of optimal tools for the generation of 3D models compatible with digital twin simulation, the evaluation of robustness and deployment times in realistic scenarios, and the compatibility with the lines of research in simulation and telematic control of the Robotics and Cybernetics Laboratory (ROBCIB) of the CAR ETSII UPM-CSIC. The combination of the tools allows an effective deployment in about an hour and a half, demonstrating its applicability in simulated rescue situations.

## General description
<div align="justify">
In the digital era, digital twins have emerged as fundamental tools for the simulation and real-time control of complex physical environments. This work presents the development of an immersive telematic control system that combines digital twin technology with virtual reality (VR), generated from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and subsequent developments derived from it such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

To illustrate the starting point, Figure 0.1 presents a typical training scenario for Digital Twins (0.1a) and the state of the art in teleoperation of robotic systems with virtual reality interfaces in the Robotics and Cybernetics Laboratory (ROBCIB) of CAR ETSII - UPM (0.1b); and Figure 0.2 presents examples of 3D models of complex physical environments in which it is proposed to deploy said digital twins.

This research seeks to demonstrate that it is possible to integrate these 3D model reconstruction technologies with rescue operations in emergency situations, providing operators with an immersive and detailed visualization of the affected environment.

The precise and realistic reconstruction of three-dimensional environments from two-dimensional images in which the digital twins of the deployed robots can operate also allows the simulation of possible catastrophe scenarios.

In this way, it not only facilitates a faster and more effective response, but also reduces the risk for rescue teams.

The main contributions of this project are the following:
1. The optimal combination of tools to obtain a 3D model compatible with the simulation of the digital twins of the robots.
2. The robustness and deployment time of the technology in realistic application situations.
3. Compatibility with the current lines of research of the Robotics and Cybernetics Laboratory (ROBCIB) of the CAR ETSII UPM-CSIC, in particular the simulation and telematic control of robots through the use of virtual reality for closer and safer collaboration between operators and robots.

The combination of the tools used in this project allows the deployment of the technology in approximately one and a half hours for a simulated rescue situation.

After discarding instant-ngp[^5] and Unity due to incompatibilities, the tools compiled in the list below have been chosen. Figure 0.3 shows the complete workflow diagram of these tools, and then Table 0.1 shows the times used for their deployment.

- FFmpeg[^6], for preprocessing, and COLMAP[^7] with the addition of hloc[^8], for obtaining the photogrammetry.
- Splatfacto[^9] (NerfStudio[^9] environment method for 3DGS[^2]) and volinga-model[^10], for generating the 3D model of the scene.
- Volinga Suite[^10], for compatibility with Unreal Engine (UE).
- UE together with the Volinga plugin[^10], for its representation in a virtual reality environment compatible with the simulation of the digital twins of the robots.
- Rosbridge[^11] and ROSIntegration[^12], for compatibility with current lines of research that use the ROS standard.
